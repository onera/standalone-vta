# Functional Simulator (C++)

This directory contains the C++ functional simulator for the VTA.  This simulator models the functional behaviour of the VTA, executing binary instructions on binary data and producing a result.

## Building

A Makefile is here to build the simulator, you must only apply the following command line in a terminal.

```
make all
```


## Usage

The simulator takes multiple binary files as input, they are generated by the `compiler/` and they are located in `OUTPUT/`:

1.  **instructions.bin**  A binary file containing the VTA instructions (generated by `operations_definition/`).
2.  **uop.bin**  A binary file containing the data pointer for executing the computation (generated by `operations_definition/`).
3.  **input.bin** A binary file containing the input vectors (generated by `data_definition/`).
4.  **weight.bin** A binary file containing the weight matrices (generated by `data_definition/`).
5.  **expected_out.bin**  An optional binary file with the expected results.

To execute the functional simulator, you can either do:
```
cd build/
./vta_simulator
```
or
```
make execute
```
